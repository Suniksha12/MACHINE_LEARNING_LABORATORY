# Laboratory Experiments:

1. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

3. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a newsample.

4. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Back propagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.

5. Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program.

6. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this
problem.

7. Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
